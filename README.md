# Project_One
First Project for JHU Data Analytics Bootcamp

We plan to examine the COVID-19 cases in the United States for trends across age groups, gender and race/ethnicity over the course of the pandemic.  Are more cases occuring in younger people as the pandemic progresses?  Are the cases in older Americans increasing or decreasing over time?  Do race/ethnicity or gender have any correlation to the number of positive cases in the United States?  We intend to analyse the data collected by the CDC to find out.
